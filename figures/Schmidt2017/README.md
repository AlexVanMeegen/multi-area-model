This folder contains the scripts to reproduce all figures of Schmidt M, Bakker R, Hilgetag C-C, Diesmann M and van Albada SJ: "Multi-scale account of the network structure of macaque visual cortex", Brain Structure and Function (2017) [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-017-1554-4](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00429-017-1554-4)

Please note: Figures 2, 5, and 8 show slight deviations from the published figures in the paper. The published figures 2 and 5 lack few data points. This error was unintentionally introduced during the review process. Importantly, the presented fits are identical in the correct figures in this repository and in the manuscript. These deviations thus do not affect the scientific conclusions.
